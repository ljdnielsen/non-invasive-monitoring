## Repository Structure Guide

This repository contains three branches so far, 'main', 'bulletin', and 'encyclopedic'. 'main' will be the final version. But until then, 'bulletin' and 'encyclopedic' will grow on their own. 'bulletin' focuses on the latest news and reports from the field, while 'encyclopedic' recapitulates the annals.

I chose this system because I couldn't decide how to write the 'Motivation' section. This way allows me to explore different approaches to literature review without creating a mess.

Please branch of any of the three branches.
