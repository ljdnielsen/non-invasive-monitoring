# Real-Time Ecosystem Monitoring

This repository holds the [TIGRR Lab](https://tigrrlab.science.unimelb.edu.au/) project expanding the dunnart model system to include non-invasive, real-time monitoring in the wild.

## Motivation

Improve trophic complexity. Raise the number of animals belonging to keystone species. Speed up keystone species' reproductive rate. Environmental Restoration and Genetic Rescue. Real-time monitoring of the trophic network and the structure of populations.

### The Decline of Biological Diversity
It is estimated that ~3/4 of the Earth was inhabited at the end of the last glacial maximum 12,000 years ago when the ice sheets started contracting. From then on the the area with human pressence increased gradually, accelerated during the 19th century with the industrialization of economies, and tapered off in the 20th century with the spread of 'Green Revolution' technologies, such as high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and controlled irrigation, that increased the output of agricultural lands [^1].
