# Real-Time Ecosystem Monitoring

This repository holds the [TIGRR Lab](https://tigrrlab.science.unimelb.edu.au/) project expanding the dunnart model system to include non-invasive, real-time monitoring in the wild.

## Motivation

This project aims to enhance real-time ecosystem monitoring of trophic interactions and population structure in the wild to facilitate interventions that will lead to:
- Greater trophic complexity.
- Larger populations of threatened species.

## Goals

The goal of the project is to develop eDNA techniques that allow the monitoring of population structure and ecological interactions of a terrestrial mammal and expanding those techniques to provide continual ('real-time') information by making the technology accessible to citizen scientists or deploying automatic sampling devices.

### eDNA-specific problems
In order to improve real-time ecosystem monitoring the following short-comings of ecosystem monitoring need to be adressed:
- Analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of eDNA.
- Establishing precise links between eDNA presence and species abundance.
- Investigating the exact sources of eDNA (the cell type of origin).
- Studying the physio-chemical factors influencing eDNA availability and degradation.

## Background

#### Human Impact on Nature

It is estimated that ~3/4 of the Earth was inhabited at the end of the last glacial maximum 12,000 years ago when the ice sheets started contracting. From then on the the area with human pressence increased gradually, accelerated during the 19th century with the industrialization of economies, and tapered off in the 20th century with the spread of 'Green Revolution' technologies, such as high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice, chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and controlled irrigation, that increased the output of agricultural lands [^1].
