## Background
To understand the existing limitations to monitoring dunnart population health we first investigated methods to confirm the presence or absence of a species. A concern that is often raised by eDNA practitioners is that they cannot confirm the absence of a species as the lack of evidence could be due to too low breadth of coverage in their samples.
The first step to addressing this problem is to identify a signal that will be ubiqoutous whereever there are dunnarts. This could be biological material in the air such as DNA on pollen.
Another method is to lure a dunnart to a place where it will without exeption leave its trace when it goes there and where the dunnart will undoubtedly go if it is present. This could be by placing tiles.
An even better way could be to confirm the presence of the dunnart using camera traps and then see if positives and negatives always perfectly correlate between camera trap and eDNA evidence.
