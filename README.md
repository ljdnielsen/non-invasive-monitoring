# Real-Time Ecosystem Monitoring

This repository holds the development of the TIGRR Lab project to expand the dunnart model system to include non-invasive, real-time monitoring in the wild.

## Motivation

Improve trophic complexity. Raise the number of animals belonging to keystone species. Speed up keystone species' reproductive rate. Environmental Restoration and Genetic Rescue. Real-time monitoring of the trophic network and the health of populations.
