### eDNA-specific problems
In order to improve real-time ecosystem monitoring the following short-comings of ecosystem monitoring need to be adressed:
- Analyzing the temporal and spatial distribution of eDNA.
- Establishing precise links between eDNA presence and species abundance.
- Investigating the exact sources of eDNA (the cell type of origin).
- Studying the physio-chemical factors influencing eDNA availability and degradation.
