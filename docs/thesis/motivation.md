The fat-tailed dunnart as a model organism.


The phylogeny of the fat-tailed dunnart.


The ecology of the fat-tailed dunnart.

The conservation status of the fat-tailed

Habitat North and south of the Murray River.

- [Fenner et al. (1934)](https://doi.org/10.2307/209495)

Difference in diet between habitats.

Flooding and subsequent decline of the population south of the river.

Current techniques for identifying the fat-tailed dunnart and determining its diet.

Environmental DNA can provide a simpler and faster method of identification.

Can we tell how many dunnarts visited a site? [^1].

- [de Flamingh et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.1021004)

Can we tell if the dunnarts in the north eat more hard insects than soft insects compared to the south?[^2]

- [Wanniarachchi (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9457)

We can describe when then animal was present in an area through time by sampling sediment deposits at different depths.

- [Barnosky et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aah4787)

Isolating dunnart DNA from the environment increases the range within which we can assess the genetic variation of populations to areas where we cannot capture the animals themselves.
